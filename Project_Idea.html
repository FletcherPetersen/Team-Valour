<p>Assessment 2 – Team Project - Report. </p>

<p>A2-Group#10, </p>

<p><strong>Team Valour.</strong></p>
<p>Original project plan & concept by <strong>Jarrod Petersen.</strong><p>

	<h2><strong>Switch Insurance</strong>, a full scale comparison & management platfrom and mobile application. </h2>

<div><img src="55025_Switch Insurance_RK_02.png" alt="Switch Insurance Logo" style="width: 875px; height: 500px; margin: 10px, 10px, 10px, 10px;"></div>

<h3>What is the ‘Switch’ project all about?</h3>

<p>Team Valour voted for Jarrod Petersen’s impressive project idea, Switch, a full cycle insurance management platform. Where Jarrod’s project idea distinguishes itself from its competitors is in the breadth of the insurer markets it will approach & the post-purchase service that is not provided by other aggregator websites. Current insurance comparison websites simply give you a price, facilitate the purchase and then leave the buyer to deal with the insurer directly. Switch Insurance, my project, will provide facilities to lodge and maintain claims, make mid-term changes & remarket policies at renewal.</p>

<h3>Why would an individual choose to use ‘Switch’, is there a need for a service like this in the market today?</h3>

<p>Our Team’s motivation to work on this project is based on the experience, research and original concept of Jarrod Petersen, and his insight into the opportunity to develop a service not currently available in the Australian Insurance market. In the year end September 2020, $19.5 Billion worth of premium was written in the Australian domestic insurance market (Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, 2020). Based on Jarrod’s proposed pricing model 1% market share would represent $46 million dollars in turnover. While every company is founded on the idea of profit, Switch intends to offer a more transparent & fair process. Current insurance comparison websites only canvas a very small percentage of the available insurers, one comparison website is also part of the same holding company that owns an insurer that regularly finds itself at the top of their ‘comparison’.</p>

<p>A service like Jarrod’s proposed project is especially useful in the current insurance landscape that is seeing reduced insurer capacity and increased premiums. We predict this trend to continue for the next two years based on data released by APRA that reports a 73.3% reduction in net profit averaged across all Australian domiciled general insurers. (Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, 2020)</p>

<p>Given the above, a service that provides easy & fair comparison is particularly useful to the consumer to ensure they continue to receive competitive premiums.</p>

<p>The key demographic for this service is for average consumers between the age of 18-50. Per the below table built on APRA data the major markets in Australia are all on the eastern coast. At launch, the service will be targeted at NSW, QLD & VIC until Switch is able to break into the market.</p>

<h3>What can ‘Switch, do for an individual and what will it offer?</h3>

<p>The main feature of the service will be product & price comparison with a focus on flawless execution and customer-centric innovations. Our goal at Switch is to have at least 5-8 insurer partners available to canvas a significant portion of the available market.</p>

<p>The user interface will have a modern minimalist design consisting of gentle colours, predominantly light blue. Major buttons will be made using soft line vectors, drawn to the shape of a car or house for the relevant product screen.</p>

<p>From the main screen, the user’s attention should initially be drawn to the large home & motor buttons with no need to scroll or search deeper into the website.</p>

<p>Once in the quote screen, underwriting questions will be presented to the user gradually & dynamically changing based on the user’s response. A bootstrap progress bar will remain at the top of the page to give the user an indication to how much of the form is left.</p>

<p>If the end user has not correctly verified a question, option or section during the sign-up process then Switch will notify the end user with a pop-up notification in resemblance of colour coded succession & warning alerts to help support the end users experience during the process.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the quote screen, users will be asked to provide an email, phone number & password to create an account, after which they will be provided with their comparison on screen.</p>

<p>From the comparison screen, the user will have access to the price & policy comparison as well as the ability to view and download the insurer’s policy wordings. On larger screen this Information will be presented in a landscape table. For smaller devices, users will have the option to select & deselect different quotes to compare which will be added to a table in real-time.</p>

<p>Considerations will need to be made for people who would prefer to make payments by monthly instalments. Some insurers will have the capability to offer direct monthly instalments however for the insurers that do not, an automated solution would need to be worked on with a premium funding company to offer users monthly instalments. Users will be required to pay before a policy is bound, removing the need for debtor control outside of dishonoured monthly instalments.</p>

<p>When a policy is active & a client is logged into the portal, the home page will show the details of all their policies, organised by due date, asset details & policy number. Each one of policies will be a link to a drop-down list with options to view, endorse (make changes) cancel & raise a claim on their policy.</p>

<p>The claim lodgement & management function will be a significant value-add of the service, providing a single point of contact between the insurer & client while also providing a service that advocates & provides advice for the client.</p>

<p>Users will have the ability to lodge claims with their insurer via through switch’s customer-centric interface via the mobile app by selecting the appropriate asset/risk. From there, the user will be asked to give details of the accident including cause, date of loss, location of incident & third-party details etc. dependant on the type of claim.</p>

<p>The app will also give the user general advice on how to proceed with the claim, including what information the insurer will need to progress a claim & what to do immediately following an accident.</p>

<p>Where relevant the user will be asked if they have photos of the damage or if they are able to take photos. Camera access will be required by the application to directly take photos and include them in the lodgement process.</p>

<p>As claims can be stressful, a claims phone number will be available for people to call a Switch employee for instructions regarding & to lodge claims if the user would prefer not to do it via the application but with Jarrod’s approach to providing a service with an emphasis on customer-centric innovation within the app/website/services and offering a fair & honest comparison service we believe that the process of handling claims at Switch will make user experience an ease.</p>


<h3>Tools & Technology</h3>

<p>Switch will have a responsive webpage optimised for small screens as well as an android & iOS application with a focus on flawless execution prior to release to a marketable scale. Each one will have the same functions, but particular focus should be made to the mobile applications to resonate with Switch’s target demographic. </p>

<p>To be feasible, development would need to include three systems for administrators, insurers & end users. Each of them with different user interfaces & functions.</p>

<p>User management & authentication will require the deployment of a MySQL or similar database system.

Due to the complexity of the project, collaboration will need to be made with other programmers & actuaries. The easiest way to do this will be via collaboration software like Atlassian’s software suite, github & Microsoft teams to name a few. </p>

<p>Existing software like that of Guidewire’s may simplify the process through integration of their solutions.

<p>Each insurer will have different requirements & systems in place which Switch will have to work to integrate into our system. This includes the development of our own rating system. Our rating system would need to connect spatial address data to assess elevation, bushland, proximity to bodies of water & cyclone exposure above the 25th parallel. </p>

<p>Alternatively, a solution would need to be made to send & retrieve data with an insurer’s own system. This will be a more complicated method a different solution is likely to be required for each insurer. </p>

<p>Because of the flexibility required to provide different solutions for each insurer, a modular approach is required & development will need to be completed in stages.</p>

<p>Regarding claims lodgement & management, the same can be said about flexibility. Not all property and casualty insurers in Australia have an externally accessible claims lodgement & management solution.
Due to Switch’s intention to hold & maintain a significant market share, an automated solution will need to be developed for this as well.
Leverage of a relationship with claims-service provider Claims Central may provide a solution to centralise data & integrate systems with Switch.</p>

<p>Website hosting will need to be provided by a third-party company with the capacity to manage potentially high traffic.

Cloud-computing services like Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services will be utilised to host external services & process back-end operations due to the lower initial cost, faster speeds & security reasons.</p>

<p>To reduce the need for human interaction, and ultimately reducing labour costs, a chatbot could sit idle in the bottom corner of the screen, idle until the user types a question. The chatbot should have the capability of answering basic system, insurance and administration questions.</p>


<h3>Skills Required</h3>

<p>A high level of proficiency in HTML & CSS would be necessary to ensure the website scales appropriately to all possible screen sizes & gives a professional but modern & minimalistic design.</p>

<p>Python or JavaScript knowledge is required to build some of the back-end functions. For example, the proposed rating engine to calculate premium & government charges as well as the dynamic generation of policy schedules & certificates of currency in PDF format.</p>

<p>Knowledge & experience in MySQL or another database management system will be extremely important in providing & automating user accounts with varying levels of control.</p>

<p>Experience in IT projects management would also be a very beneficial skill given all of the possible parties that will need to be involved for the project to be plausible.</p>

<p>Lastly, outside of IT skills, negotiation & communication skills would be paramount in garnering the support of insurers, premium funders & other stakeholders. Generally, Insurer’s do not have issue’s reaching their market but rather with competitive pricing & loss ratio’s. For this reason, it is important to show an insurer that an emphasis is placed on data, analytics & sustainable underwriting practices.</p>



<h3>Outcome</h3>

<p>The outcome of this project is ultimately to have an automated broking program for the domestic home & motor insurance market in Australia. If Switch has achieved all its goals by the time it reaches the market, little human touch will be required for the entire process. This is necessary if Switch is to achieve and maintain 1% market share or higher as that is equivalent to 281,240 home & motor insurance policies (Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, 2020)</p>

<p>A key indicator of success is reduced underwriting costs for insurer’s & increased trust from consumers.</p>

<p>A 2016 report by market research firm Roy Morgan that measured consumer’s confidence in 30 different professions, placed insurance brokers at 27 out of 30. Only three places higher than the notorious car sales for ethic and honesty. (Roy Morgan Research Ltd, 2016) Ultimately, the main indicator of success is consumer trust & satisfaction.</p>

<p>If Switch can achieve this, they will be the most fair, honest & affordable insurance comparison service in Australia.</p>

<h3>A3 Artefacts Plan</h3>

<p>On the 17/01/2021 the team convened, on the agenda for the meeting was a discussion regarding artefacts for A3.</p>

<p>It was decided that we would set in place a plan to develop a flowchart of the dynamic quote and claims screens.</p>

<p>The point of this is to link certain underwriting questions to other questions. An example of this might be someone declaring their walls are made of asbestos or EPS. As these are considered high risk by insurers, further information would be required like the total percentage these materials make-up of the property.</p>

<p>The team will collaborate to achieve this. As I have experience in the industry, I will likely provide the data to the team to design and put the flowchart together.</p>

<p>If we have enough time left in A3 once this is done, the team will collaborate to design and code a PC landing page or mobile application.</p>
