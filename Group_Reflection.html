							<h3>Elisha Rackley</h3>
								<p>As a bunch of strangers only having met online a few weeks ago, not knowing anything about each other, I feel as though we have really come together as team in that time. The team as a whole has been communication centered for the most part which really surprised me as communication can often be so difficult, especially when we are all in different cities and time zones. The other thing that surprised me was the group participation, I often found that I was the last one to contribute to sections so that is something I need to improve on, but most other team members have been really on the ball and just getting things done which has been really incredible. One thing that I did learn about groups is they aren’t always bad. Up until now, I have never done a group project that has come together as well as this one had. All of my previous experience has been in face to face groups and trying to get things done together but here we have been getting things done on our own in our own time, then coming together to check in on each other and ask questions and help out other members in areas and in return they are more than willing to help teach you and help you learn. </p>

							<h3>Fletcher Petersen</h3>
								<p>I believe as a team that started late and had extras join late, we did well in organising and committing to meetings. Most meetings ran smoothly even with a different chair each week. I think one thing we could improve on is our communication outside of the meetings. There were a few times I was left thinking what everyone was up to with the work we had assigned during the meetings. Also, regarding communication, we could have used GitHub more effectively with this assignment, so everyone knew what work was done as it would be committed and pushed for everyone to see. One thing I learnt about groups is that when you have six people between three time zones, all with different working schedules, it can be hard to maintain contact with them and organise meetings, even though we were lucky with most people being available for the meetings we did have. I don’t believe the GitHub repo accurately shows how much work everyone has done as a lot of work was done on teams and added all at once rather than being added as we worked. As stated above, using GitHub more effectively would fix this.</p>


							<h3>Jarrod Petersen</h3>
								<p>I am very proud of how this team pulled together. As Fletcher mentioned our group was formed a little bit later than ideal. I don’t believe we would have completed as much in the timeframe we did if it weren’t for the frequent & strong communication from our leader. <br><br>
								The members of our group clicked well together & communicated well through our Microsoft teams meetings. For the most part, these meetings were well documented.<br><br>
								I believe we could have improved upon our delegation. It seemed at times as though some people were taking on more work than needed rather than work being delegated evenly.  <br><br>
								I have learned that everybody’s schedule is different. We all work different hours and are spread across three different time zones which at times can make active collaboration difficult. <br><br>
								Because we opted to build on Fletcher’s A1 website template, he championed a significant amount of GitHub, at the time of writing this there is still a reasonable amount of content to be added but so far, my only contribution was jump links which did not scale well to the screens & I removed it from the code two days later. The amount of commits from each person does not accurately represent the share of the work complete on Microsoft Teams. </p>

							<h3>Keegan Whitfield</h3>
								<p>As I joined this team well after its inception, I initially felt a bit like an outsider. The GitHub repository was established many of the draft documents were established, and the project had been decided upon. I harboured on animosity to the group for being this far along. After attending my first meeting with the group, my feelings of being an isolated individual faded rapidly. <br><br>
								I got the impression when I joined the group that Jarrod’s project idea had been manifested long before assignment one, as such the bulk of the work had come from him. I was initially concerned about this work balance, until I thought back to friend of mine who runs a small business independently, she refuses most outside assistance too. But not because she or Jarrod are stubborn, but because at the end of the day, it is their name on the business. <br><br>
								My one regret was that I had wanted to contribute more. My work schedule interfered with my intentions. Matthew tried to tell me this was not my fault, but as I said to him at the time; I still need to take responsibility for my time management. This feeling of inadequacy stemmed from the knowledge that this team that had accomplished so much had other members that have full time jobs, I should be no different. I knew this would be aa problem going forward in my studies, these other members have shown me that there is a healthy balance that I can strive for. </p>

							<h3>Mathew Lawton</h3>
								<p>As we all relieved ourselves of the pressures of A1 and thought we could have a little break, the realization that A1 was nothing in comparison to A2 and the nerves started to settle in. Those nerves were soon crushed by the early friendships and team spirits that were formed since day one and realizing that I wasn’t alone in this SNAFU. <br><br>
								Team Valour was very collaborative and excelled in forming the basic structure and templates for the entire team to engage in, early on. I believe this led our group to succession in regard to confidently collaborating on assignment 2.  <br><br>
								In order to receive the marks deserved by all students, I have to say that the area of participation needs to be improved for A3. One member within Team Valour should not be taking on any responsibilities or duties of other members. I think some members have duties and responsibilities that I believe could be approved upon including my own participation in some areas.   <br><br>
								A few things I found very surprising was the ease of communication and how well everybody worked together in a supportive environment. I also found it surprising reading the profiles of some of my peers early on and reading about how they see themselves as individuals and described themselves as quite people and not leaders but what I witnessed over the course of this assignment was amazing leadership, creativity, work ethics and a passion to learn not only in times of meeting deadlines but in overall participation and a desire for the whole team to succeed.  <br><br>
								One thing I have learned about groups and working in teams while studying at university is that it does not matter much for your talents or previous experience in the industry, what matters is collaborative teamwork and intelligence in building a strong and friendly environment for all peers to engage in and facilitate research together.  <br><br>
								I think that the engagement of commits on our GitHub by all members has been really great! </p>

								<h3>Group Reflection</h3>
									<p>The majority of the group agrees that communication was one thing the group handled well. Also agreeing that, as a group that formed late with late additions and no prior communication/planning before the group formation, that we have all gelled well together, been efficient in completing tasks.  Everyone also seems to agree that it was great to have the team all together twice a week despite being in different locations and time zones, but outside of the meetings it was a bit difficult with there being very contrasting work schedules and utilising very different times of the day to complete work for the assignment. We have all come together with very different personalities and with no two members having the same personality according to the myers-briggs test. <br><br>
									Some room for improvement for the next assignment would be that the group could start earlier and have less pressure towards the due date. Which should be easier as we have discussed some aspects of Assignment 3 together already and we are already a group and familiar with each other. We all seem to be getting along really well, with genuine catch up happening in team meetings before the meeting actually starts so there shouldn’t be any change to the group members for the next assignment. <br><br>
									It seems to be unanimous among the team that the way tasks were delegated could be improved on. This would make it clearer for the group to understand the exact task they are responsible for and to ensure the workload is spread evenly amongst the team. It would also benefit the team as a whole as we would likely progress towards our goals quicker if we aren’t spending time trying to work out what still needs to be completed and what has yet to be done. <br><br>
									Another thing we could try do in future is to use the repository more instead of Microsoft Teams so that way it is clearer that everyone is contributing even though they aren’t the one pushing their paragraph to the website as the repository currently does not reflect the contributions accurately. This should be easier to do down the track now that we have the website there and everyone is more familiar with GitHub and signed into their RMIT accounts as opposed to collaborating with the group repository on personal accounts by mistake so their RMIT accounts does not accurately reflect their contribution. <br><br>
