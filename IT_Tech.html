							<h3>Fletcher Petersen - Autonomous Vehicles.</h3>

								<h4>What Are Autonomous Vehicles and What Do They Do?</h4>
									<p>An autonomous vehicle, or self-driving car, is a vehicle that uses a variety of sensors to move through the environment safely with almost no human control. There are no full-autonomous vehicles on the market at the present time but there is a wide range of vehicles that can use autonomous features to make driving safer and easier on the user. Full-autonomous driving would involve a vehicle that can operate on its own in all types of weather and driving conditions without any human input or intervention. This would be considered level 5 autonomy. The levels are determined the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) International. <br><br>
									Level 2 would be considered state of the art as it is where you will find today’s autonomous vehicles, such as vehicles using Tesla’s AutoPilot system and Cadillac Super Cruise. This level of autonomy allows for a vehicle to use an array of cameras and sensors to keep the car at a certain speed and remain in the correct lane while remaining at a safe distance from other vehicles. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, stated while accepting the Axel Springer Award "I am extremely confident of achieving full autonomy and releasing it to the Tesla customer base next year" (Axel Springer SE, 2020). There is a ‘Full Self-Driving Beta system’ available to some Tesla owners, however this is not level 5 autonomy with user input still required. Musk also said he believes “10 years from now almost all cars will have full-autonomy.” <br><br>
									The technology involved in autonomous vehicles includes cameras, radar, lidar, ultrasonic sensors, GNSS, and more (Dawkins, T, 2021). Cameras can be used to send what they see to an AI-based program to determine what objects are around. This is great for daytime driving but will become less useful when visibility is low. Radar is used in most vehicles now to determine distance between the vehicle and approaching objects. This is necessary for autonomous vehicles to be able to stop when approaching an object or vehicle. Radar will usually use 2 frequencies, either 77GHz or 24GHz. 77Ghz is better for long-range sensing while 24Ghz is best for close range sensing. However, radar is not optimal for object detection. Lidar is a great sensor for autonomous vehicles as it emits a laser that reflects off the objects it hits and is received by a photodetector. This allows for a three-dimensional image of the environment to be processed, which is essential for the vehicle to determine the objects in its environment with the use of an AI algorithm. Ultrasonic sensors are what is currently used for parking sensors. This is useful for autonomous vehicles so they may park themselves, which is a feature used today by some higher-end vehicles. </p>

								<h4>What Is the Likely Impact of Autonomous Vehicles?</h4>
									<p>Impacts of autonomous vehicles may include changes to the economy, various industries, insurance, safety, and commuting (Ohio University, 2020). Autonomous vehicles remove the need for a person behind the wheel of the vehicle. This means there is a lot of potential job loss. In America, one in eight jobs have driving as an essential task for workers, there are more than 3 million professional truck drivers, and more than 10 million Americans hold Commercial Driver’s Licenses (CDL) of some kind (Zurschmeide, 2016). This could mean millions of people to lose their jobs, or have reduced responsibility, and therefore have considerable pay cuts. With the loss of jobs and pay there is potential for a recession, affecting the driver’s economy. <br><br>
									Another potential impact of autonomous vehicles in the insurance industry. Insurance company may have to ‘shift the core of their business model, focusing mainly on insuring car manufacturers from liabilities from technical failure of their AVs, as opposed to protecting private customers from risks associated with human error in accidents’ (Bertoncello and Wee, 2015, para. 8). <br><br>
							  	Autonomous vehicles will also change the way we think about commuting. The average daily commute time in 2017 was 66 minutes, increased from 49 minutes in 2002 (Ma, 2019). Autonomous vehicles will allow for commuters to spend that time relaxing or doing something else rather than focusing their attention on driving. Autonomous vehicles may also reduce the average commute time. If a fleet of autonomous vehicles communicates and works together it can improve traffic flow by at least 35% (ScienceDaily, 2019). Autonomous vehicles communicating with each other also improve safety when a human driver who was driving aggressively was added. The cars were able to give way to avoid the driver. This not only increases the commuting experience but also safety when the road is filled with autonomous vehicles, and human drivers.</p>

								<h4>How Will This Affect You?</h4>
									<p>Cars have changed significantly since the first car was patented in 1886. With the introduction of automatic transmission in 1939 which now sells many more units than manual versions, with some new models of cars not even making manual versions anymore. Now with autonomous vehicles I believe it will change the way people look at travelling completely. I currently own and drive a manual car and find it hard to picture not even being in control of the vehicle that is transporting me. I personally like driving, and being from a regional city, there is not as much public transport so driving is generally the best option. I think given time and as popularity of autonomous vehicles grows, and hopefully the price goes down, I will become more inclined to use autonomous vehicles as my mode of transport. <br><br>
									I also believe the older generations that will be even more used to being in control of what the vehicle does will struggle even more than myself to own and use an autonomous vehicle. I find that a significant amount of people from older generations struggle to trust new technology. So, something like a vehicle with complete control of the path it takes and the decisions that must be made is something that most people will struggle to come to terms with. When I asked my mum if she would be willing to buy and use an autonomous vehicle when they come out, she said “Not a chance. I would be too nervous not being in control. I didn’t even trust cruise control when it first came out”. Cruise control was invented before she was born, but I assume she means when it was popularised and when she first drove a vehicle with cruise control.</p>

							<h3>Jarrod Petersen - Rasperry Pi, Arduinos and small computer devices. </h3>

								<h4>What are small computing devices and what can they do?</h4>  
									<p>Small computing devices like raspberry pi & arduino, which can be generalised as single-board computing, are small devices that are used to process data in a cost-effective and space saving manor. Single-board processing devices have aided the influx of smart-home devices, drones & data collection. <br><br>
									Small computing devices can collect & process data from several other hardware units. For example a weather station that may get several different data points such as temperature, rainfall windspeed and humidity. All the data can be collected via various sensors, all connected to the small computing device. <br><br>
									Applications have been proposed to the possibility of low-cost hydrologic data monitoring in remote & data scarce regions through a single-board computer system. Arduino is mentioned as a potential low cost alternative through the use of open-source software to extend existing networks. (Silja V. Hund, 2016) <br><br>
									Single board computing devices are also being used as an alternative to traditional computer clusters. Raspberry pi units are relatively inexpensive making it easy to expand clusters. </p>

								<h4>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</h4>
									<p>In 1980, Bernard M. Oliver wrote of the significant technological advances made in the reduction of size & cost of computers. He mentions in 1968 the cost of a single 64kb machine would cost $50,000 without any input or output devices. 12 years later, around the time the GUI reached the market, the same amount of money would buy you a machine with 256kb memory & 50mb storage. (Oliver, 1980) <br><br>
									Fast forward 40 years to 2020 where a Samsung Galaxy S20 has 31,250 times more memory than a computer of the time. <br><br>
									Given the above, it would be uneducated to assume that single-board computing devices will not decrease in size and increase in power in the near future, providing even more practical applications for future raspberry pi & Arduino models. This will contribute to a reduction in cost, making existing devices like robot vacuum cleaners, google home & Amazon Alexa more compact, efficient and affordable. </p>

								<h4>What technological or other developments make this possible? </h4>
									<p>The invention of the microprocessor like the ARM Cortex found in the google home has made efficient processing of data capable in a very small format with minimal cooling required. </p>
									<p>NAND flash memory is a type of non-volatile, rewritable memory that is directly attached to the board. The invention of rewritable flash memory allowed for programs to be stored directly on the chip and also advancements in solar panel efficiency</p>

							<h3>Mathew Lawton - Machine Learning.</h3>
								<h4>What is Machine Learning and what does it do? </h4>
									<p>Machine Learning is the wonderous world within the branches of Artificial Intelligence where we answer questions using data. <br><br>

									Machine Learning is the process of a computer system learning how to interpret data and algorithms through experiences to optimize its approach over time. With prior development of software or an application, a computer system can be trained to interpret this information and provide an output to a desired set of requirements applied by the user. <br>
									Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (Or possibly, Artificial Assistance.), the most recent stages of development within Machine Learning include areas such as, Recommendation Engines on platforms like Netflix that to some extent can predict a recommendation tailored to you or a retail store that can recommend a “You might also like” product to machine learning being used by big banks and insurance companies to detect fraud. Machine Learning is also used in retail via inventory and stock control that can provide answers to inventory issues that illude human planners and let's not forget about the importance of machine learning in the ‘machine automation’, sector and more precisely, self-driving vehicles and the implication they could have on society. To put this into perspective, let's take a look at some of the things that are being done today by developers, self starters, entrepreneurs, companies and organizations: <br><br>

									<strong>Apple</strong> – The wizards at Apple use machine learning in many ways, sometimes as simple as to help the iPad's software distinguish between a user accidentally pressing their palm against the screen while drawing with the Apple Pencil, and an intentional press meant to provide an input. Cool right? <br>

									<strong>Azure </strong>- Let me talk about a fraction of the capabilities of machine learning in this example of Scandinavian Airlines (SAS), using machine learning to accurately identify fraud with proficiency that wasn’t possible through manual methods. In the case of retroactively registering a flight for EuroBonus miles—a common source of fraud—the new system predicts fraud with 99 percent accuracy. <br>

									<strong>Salesforce</strong> – Through its so-called machine learning technology, “Einstein”, Salesforce is able to analyse every aspect of a customer's relationship within a company. (Information via https://em360tech.com/tech-news/top-ten/top-10-companies-using-machine-learning/ ) <br><br>

									With this kind of information, I bet you are wondering about some of the possibilities of what can be done with machine learning, right? Well, not only will we be able to find out the answer to timeless questions such as, “who would win in a fight: A duck sized horse or a 100 horse sized ducks”, but we will also be able to support networks within our society such as, Healthcare where we are able to predict patient health and/or symptoms of a disease/virus, and AR/VR Development where we are capable of doing who knows what? I for one need further study and research into that wonderous aspect of IT! <br><br>

									From once far-fetched sci fi concepts like mind-transferable technology in Dune(Auther, Frank Herbert, 1865.) and the inception and click bait surrounding Elon Musk's, ‘Neuralink’, that is gaining significant scientific research and support to real life strategies such as ‘The Link’, an application that connect to thousands of neurons in the brain to support rehabilitation with people who have suffered spinal cord injury, and don’t forget about the scary realisation of how things like Deep Fakes and the data obtained to initiate machine learning can have a great impact on society and furthermore, how can we differentiate ideas and concepts that may be generated by bias opinion/s? <br><br>

									What if we take a step back and consider the likely impact of machine learning and which people may be affected and, is there a select group of people that organisations using machine learning may target specifically for any reasons? Let's consider that, for example, if over the last 3-5 years, the precision of facial recognition technology has increased drastically, bringing scientists from the 26 percent error rate back in 2011 to about 3 percent in 2020. In the future, the quality of facial recognition will definitely improve, making computers powerful substitutes for human eyes. The improved quality of computer vision will expand the reach of machine learning applications in healthcare, security, art, and retail. Now I know you're wondering, “but how can machine learning in healthcare, art or retail affect me and my family? Considering the rapid development of machine learning, it’s no wonder that companies all over the world bet on these technologies. Now that dozens of corporations are becoming leaders in Ai and machine learning research, I believe it is a basic right for everyone to have an educational platform to aid in supporting and understanding the implications of machine learning on their life, I believe that after further research into this field that dis-information is a bump in the road for machine learning. I believe that the likely impact of machine learning is based on the fundamentals of assisted intelligence and via the support of computer systems and computer networks, we will be able to assist in the management of predicting possible outcomes in many areas such as healthcare, resources, infrastructure and commerce which will aid millions of individuals across the globe and their succession in projects, life and personal health and career development. <br><br>

									Another likely impact of machine learning is that as a group of peers at RMIT University, we will be able to implement ideas and concepts within the AI and machine learning capabilities that will help us to succeed in our team project, learning style and understanding of this wonderous world within the branches of Artificial Intelligence. <br><br>

									Ok, I’ll admit that I don’t know enough about the finer mechanics of machine learning, but I can’t help to wonder - like a 13-year-old who just discovered Stargate, SG1 - the endless new roles and possibilities that are being created, as the speed of implementation and new business systems exponentially increase, and IT operations are becoming more complex and efficient in their process. <br><br>

									Let’s put ego’s aside for a moment while I say something that was inspired by my RMIT University Lecturer, Anthony Clapp, this is not a word for word quote, it was just my interpretation from a webinar that, as humans, our brains can’t keep up with the volume, veracity, and variety of Big Data which I believe is the livelihood of machine learning. Machines want to eat, machines are hungry for data, machines want Big McData. <br><br>

									Machine learning can slither in silently and fill in the gaps between humans, Team Valour and Big Data, providing an assisted intelligence and speed for real-time decision making and troubleshooting that can be facilitated by an individual or a group of individuals. <br><br>

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
									Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies, who for certain can not only suggest this, but confirm this? And what kind of changes in society will aid in the facilitation and acceptance of machine learning, are these questions that we should be asking ourselves or are these topics we should be trying to discuss with the masses as educated individuals? </p>
