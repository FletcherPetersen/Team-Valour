					<h3>What Common Elements Are There, If Any?</h3>
						<p>Our common elements across Team Valour are Teamwork, Communication, Software Programming Languages, Competencies and Attributes. Which are great for building our current team dynamics and learning development techniques for Assignment 2. Examples of common elements between jobs includes Jarrod and Fletcher’s job both requiring implementing solutions for clients. Mathew and Elisha are both creating and developing software. Fletcher and Keegan are both dealing with networking for clients. </p>

					<h3>What Differentiates Each Position From The Others, If Anything?</h3>
						<p>Some differences in positions may include the industries that each position targets, Jarrod’s being insurance and Mathew’s being healthcare. But other differences include Jarrod’s job implementing technology-based solutions for an insurance business. Whereas Mathew’s job is about developing software which can be implemented for healthcare. While both Fletcher and Keegan’s roles are about networks, Fletcher’s job is about laying the foundations for the clients need. Whereas Keegan’s job is more about the daily troubleshooting and assistance (correct me if I am wrong there Keegan). While Mathew and Elisha’s positions are similar with both being creators of new things. Mathew’s job is more generalised and could be software used for anything to do with healthcare. While Elisha’s is specifically mobile application development but can be developing apps that target any user.</p>

					<h3>How Similar Or Different Are Your Career Plans Across The Group?</h3>
						<p>Information Technology, Healthcare, Infrastructure, Security and Technical support are our ideal areas of industry and while the industry may be different, we all desire to work in Information Technology and the technical aspects of a career in this field. There are some similarities including two people wanting to be developers, two wanting to be implementing solutions for clients, two focusing on networks. The differences come more when you look at the specifics of each title as there is differences in industries, target users, amongst other things. One major difference is that Jarrod’s job may not technically be classed as an IT role. While it does require an advanced knowledge of IT systems, that is more for the sake of accurately translating requests between an IT team & a business Team. </p>
